_**Novel Biosensing System & Device for Foodborne Contaminants**_

The novel biosensing system & device facilitate rapid detection of the most common foodborne contaminants, including bacterial pathogens, metabolic toxins, and heavy metals. The laboratory sensing system is constructed based upon novel pairing of nanomaterials and the use of electrochemistry principles combined with the change in luminescence of molecules. It helps to quantify the specific concentration of these contaminants.

The system is concealed in a rigorously designed and portable physical device that can be used in households, communities, and clinical point-of-care settings. It is affordable and has advanced parameters in sensitivity, stability, accuracy, selectivity, and many more parameters compared to other options in the market as the first of its kind.

The system is paired in use **with the new application developed, SafePlates**. Its current capabilities include scan-to-detect functionality for ingredients and health risks in food and offering an AI assistant in designing a healthy diet for users. The goal is for the application to analyze outputs from the biosensor to interpret the safety level of contaminants quantified and advise users on a personal level.
